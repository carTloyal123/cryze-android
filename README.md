# Cryze
Cryze is a Wyze Gwell Camera Bridge that allows you to stream your Gwell based Wyze cams to locations of your choosing.

## What is Cryze?
Cryze is an open-source project dedicated to providing you access to your own video camera data from Gwell-based Wyze cameras. I believe in giving you control over your camera footage without any restrictions.
